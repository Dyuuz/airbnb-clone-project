# Team Roles

A successful software development project like the Airbnb Clone requires collaboration across multiple specialized roles. Each team member contributes unique expertise to ensure the delivery of a functional, secure, and scalable application. Below are the primary roles and their responsibilities within this project:

1. Business Analyst (BA)

The Business Analyst bridges the gap between the client‚Äôs vision and the technical team. They analyze business needs, gather requirements, and translate them into detailed documentation for developers. In this project, the BA ensures that user stories and booking workflows align with real-world use cases and business goals.

2. Product Owner (PO)

The Product Owner defines the product vision, prioritizes the feature backlog, and ensures the end product meets user expectations. They balance business goals and technical feasibility, making key decisions about feature development and roadmap direction throughout the project lifecycle.

3. Project Manager (PM)

The Project Manager oversees the entire development process, ensuring tasks are completed on time and within budget. They facilitate communication across all roles, track progress, and mitigate risks. The PM ensures that milestones‚Äîsuch as API integration, database setup, and CI/CD configuration‚Äîare achieved as planned.

4. UI/UX Designer

The UI/UX Designer transforms the product vision into an intuitive and appealing user interface. They create user flows, wireframes, and prototypes, ensuring a seamless experience for users browsing listings, booking stays, or managing accounts. Their design principles guide front-end developers in implementing a consistent look and feel.

5. Software Architect

The Software Architect designs the system‚Äôs high-level architecture and selects the appropriate technologies. For this Airbnb Clone, the architect defines how Django, MySQL, and GraphQL interact and ensures scalability, security, and maintainability across all components.

6. Software Developers

Software Developers implement the application‚Äôs core features.

Backend Developers handle database logic, API endpoints, authentication, and server-side functionality.

Frontend Developers implement the user-facing components and ensure a responsive interface.

Full-stack Developers manage both front-end and back-end aspects, ensuring seamless data flow across the application.

7. Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer

QA Engineers verify that the application performs according to specifications. They design test cases, conduct functional and non-functional testing, and report issues. Their goal is to ensure that all booking, authentication, and payment features work flawlessly and meet performance standards.

8. Test Automation Engineer

Test Automation Engineers create automated scripts to continuously test the application‚Äôs stability after updates. They design and maintain automated test suites that reduce manual testing time, ensuring that core Airbnb functionalities remain reliable during frequent code deployments.

9. DevOps Engineer

The DevOps Engineer streamlines deployment and maintenance processes. They configure CI/CD pipelines (e.g., using GitHub Actions), manage Docker containers, and ensure smooth integration between development and production environments. Their work enables rapid, reliable, and secure application updates.
